## Overview of Election Audit

### Purpose
I received this data:
[electResults](electResults.txt)

A Colorado Board of Elections employee asked for support in an audit of a recent local congressional election. The board asked for the total votes, county votes, percentage of votes per county, total number of votes per county, largest county turnout, the percentage of votes and total votes of each individual running for the position, and the winner, the winner's vote count, and the winning percentage of the winner. Below is a file with all of these results.

## Election Audit Summary

After further analysis, I believe there are two instances that the script can be modified to incorporate other elections with further modifications. The first instance is by adding the political party of the individuals running for the local congressional election. Additionally, the voters cna input their political affiliation as well. By adding both of these instances, we can collect and analyze data to see if there is a political preference and/or a political majority for a favorite person and party to win local congressional election.
